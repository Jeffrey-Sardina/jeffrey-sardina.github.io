            Ccaizhdi uses a base-10 system, similar to the one most people in the West are used to. However, it is not the same. There is no symbol for 0, but the Ccaizhdi still can do all their math without that symbol. What they have is called a "bijective number system", which is a way of replaciong 0 with a digit that instead has a value of 10. All arithmetic is still possible, just a little different.
            <br><br>
            We are used to equations like this:<br>
            &nbsp   155<br>
                +   275<br>
                =   430<br>
            <br>
            Every time a number exceeds 9, we 'carry' the next place over. The Ccaizhdi numbers are the same, with one difference: youcarry when you exceed 10, not 9. For the sake of an example, let A be 10, much like <p class='ccaizhdi'>0</p> is the Ccaizhdi symbol for 10.
            <br><br>
            The above equation becomes:<br>
            &nbsp   155<br>
                +   275<br>
                =   42A<br>
            <br>
            Step-by-step: When adding 7 and 5, you get 10, which is A. Write A in the answer space, and do not carry anyting. when adding 5 and 7, you get 12. Write 2 and carry the 1. When you add the 1, the 2, and the carried 1, you get 4 and write that down. Thus, the result is 42A.
            <br><br>
            So how does one convert this to the system we are used to? If there are no A's or 0s in the number you want to convert, then it is just the same as you are used to. Everything stays the same, as in 124 => 124. Otherwise, every time you see an A, add one to the nukber in front of it, and replace the A with a 0. An A with nothing in front of it becomes '10'. Thus: 42A => 430, and A56 => 1056.
            <br><br>
            Of course, since the Ccaizhdi write top-to-bottom, left-to-right, their equations look a bit different. The same equation written in Ccaizhdi would be:
            <p class='ccaizhdi'>
                &nbsp   155<br>
                +       275<br>
                =       420<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            (Excuse the + and = for the moment; I have yet to create Ccaizhdi symbols for those). Below, I have included a breakdown of how to type these, as well as given a text box to play around with the Ccaizhdi numbers. Have fun!
