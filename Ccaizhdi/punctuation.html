            Ccaizhdi uses a somewhat different punctuation from English, though at a broad level there are many similarities. The biggest differennce is that they have fewer symbols, which tend to be more versatile. The table below lists them, and I then explain their uses in more detail.
            
            <br><br>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Keyboard &emsp;</th>
                    <th>Symbol function &emsp;</th>
                    <th>Symbol &emsp;</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>!</td>
                    <td>raised / strengthened voice or exclamations</td>
                    <td class='ccaizhdi'>!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>?</td>
                    <td>lowered / saddened voice or questions</td>
                    <td class='ccaizhdi'>?</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>< ></td>
                    <td>Start and end quotes</td>
                    <td class='ccaizhdi'>< ></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>.</td>
                    <td>full stop</td>
                    <td class='ccaizhdi'>.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>,</td>
                    <td>listing, introducing relative clauses</td>
                    <td class='ccaizhdi'>,</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>.,</td>
                    <td>connecting non-relative clauses, offsetting lists</td>
                    <td class='ccaizhdi'>.,</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <br><br>
            The Ccaizhdi ! is used not only when someone is shouting or raising their voice, but when they strengthen it--such as speaking with great determination without even raising your voice. It can be used for exclamations of shock, but is never used for exclamations of fear. Those take a full stop (.) instead.

            The Ccaizhdi ? is used not only for questions, but also when someone speaks in a sorrowful or deep voice. Ccaizhdi lower their voice when they ask questions, which is why this symbol came to be a question mark.

            The Ccaizhdi , is used in all cases English uses a comma. What we call the Oxford comma (is, writing "a, b, and c" rather than "a, b and c") is mandatory in Ccaizhdi.<br>
            For example:
            <ul>
                <li>I see ducks, elephants, and dragons.</li>
                <li>The shrine, which is on that hill, is large.</li>
                <li>I would, if I could.</li>
                <li>I want do, but I cannot.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>

            The Ccaizhdi ., is at a board level similar to a semicolon. When needed, it can also act like a colon or a dash. However, it may never offset relative clauses--only the Ccaizhdi comma can do that.<br>
            For example:
            <ul>
                <li>I see a duck., the duck sees me.</li>
                <li>I see a few animals., lions, tigers, and bears</li>
            </ul>

            The Ccaizhdi quotes <> and full stop . work they do in English.
