            <h1>Welcome to Jeffrey Seathrún Sardina's Website!</h1>
            Hello! This site is a sort of catch-all for everything I do, and is under (very) active development. Check back later as more is added -- everything from D&D worlds to machine learning resources!<br><br>

            Here are my current projects (that I've uploaded here so far):
            <ul>
                <li><a href="Ccaizhdi/">Ccaizhdi Conlang</a>, an invested language I am working on!</li>
                <li><a href="Focloir-Trachtais/">Foclóir Tráchtais</a> the dictionary of Irish-language computer science / machine learning terms I am using for my thesis!</li>
                <li><a href="Research/">Researcb</a> all of my research outputs, both formal and informal, in one place!</li>
                <li><a href="Writings/">Writings</a> an assortment of writing I have done, ranging from silly to serious!</li>
            </ul>

            I'll probably put this site under some open-source license soon, but for the moment I am being held back by the (constant) threat of generative AI (I'm looking at you, ChatGPT) stealing and canibalising my work. Until I can find a license that bans this, all rights are reversed. Nothing on this site, or any element of it, may be used to train AI models without prior written permission, in writing, from me.
