            <h1>Boycott AI</h1>
            Day after day, more companies are announcing plans to cut human workers in favor of AI "assistants". To cut out human artists and replace them with AI slop. To organize mass misinformation campaigns on social media and the Internet. And quite honestly -- I've lost track of how many companies I want to boycott over this.

            <br><br>

            So I'm making a list. This list is not just for any company that "uses AI" -- it's for (what I see as) the worst. And for each company is a list of alternatives, and evidence of harms caused by their use of AI. This is actively being updated -- so expect more as time goes on. You can find that below. If you have a company you want to suggest for inclusion, please see the inclusion criteria and contact information below.

            <h2>AI Boycott List</h2>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h3>Google</h3>
            Google has a <i>ton</i> of sources of revenue. Online, their primary source is via privacy invasion (ads and training AIs on user data). If you do use Google, at the very least do not use Google Chrome (Brave and Firefox are good alternatives). And, if you are on Firefox, install an ad-blocker like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> (Brave has an ad-blocker built-in). This way, Google will have less of an ability to profit off of you.

            <h2>Inclusion Criteria</h2>
            There are a ton of companies that use AI -- and an ton again who drive immense harms through that use. This list is intended, however, to be for a consumer boycott. It's also meant to be for companies that people might not know use AI. Specifically, companies on this list must meet the following criteria:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Use of AI in a particularly harmful way.</strong> Many companies use AI -- this list aims to focus on those that are driving the most immediate harms.</li>
                <li><strong>Be generally available to consumers.</strong> Many companies that use AI primarily have corporate partners, not private consumers. Boycotting such companies is of less effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Be at least moderately popular.</strong> If fewer than 1 in 10 people are aware of the company, then including them here will have little effect. The goal is to focus on targets that are easy to collectively act on.</li>
            </ol> 


            <h2>Suggestions</h2>
            If you want to suggest a company for inclusion here, you can contact me at <u>jeffreysardina [at] duck [full stop] com</u>. Please include:
            <ol>
                <li>The name of the company</li>
                <li>A 1-2 sentence description of how they are using AI in a particularly harmful way. Some examples: spreading misinformation, producing high carbon emissions or other environmental harms, or replacing human jobs.</li>
                <li>An list of alternate companies that provide similar services and do not use AI. This part is critical -- if there is not something to replace the company with, then this list will have far less value.</li>
                <li>Verifiable evidence from for the above (for example, news media). If you link to a company page rather than news media, please provide an archive.org or similar link to the version of the webpage in qhich the comapny admits AI use, to prevent it from being taken down or changed later.</li>
